# customer-churn-prediction
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning models. Customer churn occurs when a customer stops using a companyâ€™s services. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to churn so that the company can take proactive measures to retain them.

## ðŸ“Š Data Source
The dataset used is the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**, which is publicly available on Kaggle:
[Telco-Customer-Churn.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

It contains customer demographic information, account details, and whether the customer churned or not.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Balance dataset using SMOTE (imbalanced-learn).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize churn distribution.
   - Check correlation between features and churn.

3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost (optimized)

4. **Model Optimization**
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
   - Confusion Matrix.
   - ROC-AUC Curve.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Logistic Regression: Accuracy â‰ˆ XX%
- Random Forest: Accuracy â‰ˆ XX%
- XGBoost (optimized): Accuracy â‰ˆ XX%

The **XGBoost model** achieved the best performance with the highest ROC-AUC score.

## âœ… Conclusion
- Churn prediction can help telecom companies focus on customers who are at risk.
- The most important features influencing churn include **tenure, monthly charges, and contract type**.
- Proactive strategies can reduce customer loss and improve revenue.
